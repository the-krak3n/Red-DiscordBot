# Notice:
The Global Audio API service has not been discontinued, yes this is a direct contradiction to the [claim](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-Status/issues/13) made by the organization Cog Creators and their [published change logs](https://docs.discord.red/en/latest/changelog_3_4_0.html#redbot-3-4-12-2021-06-17) and discord announcement.

The Global Audio API is a service that has been alive for over 2 years, long prior to it being used by the Cog Creators organization.

Cog Creators lost their ability to use the service, after the fact they have decided to make a claim about the Global API being discontinued, which is not true as I the owner of the API will keep it alive and maintained as originally stated.

# Overview

Red is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your
liking, making it completely customizable. This is a *self-hosted bot* – meaning you will need
to host and maintain your own instance. You can turn Red into an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot,
new best friend or all of these together!  

[Installation](#installation) is easy, and you do **NOT** need to know anything about coding! Aside
from installing and updating, every part of the bot can be controlled from within Discord.

**The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:**

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
- Trivia (lists are included and can be easily added)
- Music features (YouTube, SoundCloud, local files, playlists, queues)
- Stream alerts (Twitch, Youtube, Picarto)
- Bank (slot machine, user credits)
- Custom commands
- Imgur/gif search
- Admin automation (self-role assignment, cross-server announcements, mod-mail reports)
- Customisable command permissions

**Additionally, other [plugins](#plugins) (cogs) can be easily found and added from our growing
community of cog repositories.**

# Installation

**The following platforms are officially supported:** 

- [Windows](https://red-discordbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_windows.html)

- Ban sync
- Welcome messages
- Casino
- Reaction roles
- Slow Mode
- AniList
- And much, much more!

# Why branching off Red.
I have been getting DM'ed a lot in the past 24 hours, so I wanted to clarify what happened.

First things first, myself leaving the Red server is a final decision, I don't need anyone reading this to cause create drama, in fact I do not want it, this is simply to clarify my actions so that it doesn't look like my decisions were due to a petty discussing in #AT.

Originally this repo was to serve as an alpha repository however going forward I will be maintaining a different version of Audio than the one bundled with Red and will not be contributing upstream.

The reason for this is due to a disagreement with Kowlin, the Lead Core developer in the Red project, I've been growing fed up with his toxicity and dictatorial attitude even more so due to him being hardly around for quite a while;
The interaction in Red's #advanced-testing channel yesterday was the tipping point where he abused his staff permissions and muted my bot while I was testing core feature, the reason given my him was "spam" and when I asked for him to unmute he said no and that I should take it up with @Twentysix if I was unhappy.

But alas, myself cutting ties with the project is not related to that singular interaction but his overall toxicity and appalling attitude towards others.

Like I mentioned on my first PR closed I will be maintaining both this repo and the Audio fork, as several users do use it.

The reason for me cutting all ties with org was Kowlin breaching the Org policies and everyone in org acting like he hasn't breached the policies;
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27962761/120639036-d5f24780-c468-11eb-92fd-3fe0dd890b59.png)

The breach of said policy (abusing owner permission without due process) is ground for removal within the org.

After My first closure Kowlin removed me from the QA team within the org without disgussing with Aika (The Lead QA as the policy requires him to do before taking action.)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27962761/120639227-0803a980-c469-11eb-8466-b61cbc1b8f85.png)

Yes there are some fundamental issues with Red, the repo, the main support server, the cog support server and the way org members, however Red is a great project and I do wish all the best for it.
I do hope Kowlin realises how shitty his attitude can be and how it is negatively affecting the community, as that is the best outcome for the project.

I will continue maintaining the Global API for Audio even if the Org wanted to revoke my access to it, because that is the best for Red users.
I will continue maintaining the Global API domain.
I will continue maintaining Edge as loads of users do depend on it.
I will continue maintaining my fork of Audio because users do depend on it.
